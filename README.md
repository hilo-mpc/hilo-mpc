HILO-MPC is a Python toolbox for **easy, flexible and fast realization of machine-learning-supported optimal control, and 
estimation problems** developed mainly at the [Control and Cyber-Physical Systems Laboratory, TU Darmstadt](https://www.ccps.tu-darmstadt.de), and the [Laboratory for Systems Theory and Control, Otto von Guericke University](http://ifatwww.et.uni-magdeburg.de/syst/). It can be used for model predictive control, moving horizon estimation, Kalman filters, solving optimal control problems and has interfaces to embedded model predictive control tools.

HILO-MPC can interface directly to [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
to create machine learning models and the [CasADi](https://web.casadi.org/) framework to efficiently
build control and estimation problems. The machine learning models can be used (almost) everywhere in the setup
of these problems.

Currently the following machine learning models are supported:

- Feedforward neural networks
- Gaussian processes
 
The following machine learning models are currently under development:
 
- Bayesian neural network
- Recurrent neural network

At the moment the following MPC and optimal control problems can be solved:

- Reference tracking nonlinear MPC
- Trajectory tracking nonlinear MPC
- Path following nonlinear MPC
- Economic nonlinear MPC
- Linear MPC
- Traditional optimal control problems

All the nonlinear MPCs support soft constraints, time-variant systems, time-varying parameters and can be used to solve 
minimum-time problems. They work for continuous-time and discrete-time models, in DAE or ODE form. Linear MPC is currently limited towards discrete-time models. 

A rich set of [examples](https://github.com/hilo-mpc/examples) is available, spanning:
- NMPC for bioreactors using hybrid first principle and learned models
- Trajectory tracking and path following model predictive control with learning and obstacle avoidance
- Output feedback MPC of a continuous stirred tank reactor with a Gaussian process prediction model
- Learning NMPC control using a neural network
- Simple LQR, PID 
- Moving horizon estimation, extended Kalman filter, unscented Kalman filter, and particle filter for a continuous stirred tank reactor
